			There are endless traps in the world of programming, and Admiral Ackbar has seen a great deal of them. This blog is a collection of some of the ones we have discovered in the admiral's emporium.

We've decided that a blog is a great way to not only make sure that we do not forget the tricks we've learned, but also to help others who are facing similar issues. Many of the obscure problems we've faced were solved through insights scattered around blogs on the internet, and we thought hey: why shouldn't we be useful to others in the same way?

			I'm an engineer with a passion for making intelligent systems. I currently write machine vision software at <a href="http://www.key.me">KeyMe</a>. Before that, I spent some time in the Computer Vision Group at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Nowadays I mostly use C++, with some Python and shell scripts here and there. I use OpenCV a fair bit, and program under Ubuntu.

One of my hobbies is photography; you can check out more of that at <a href="http://krystof.litomisky.com">The Klog</a>. Some of my programming work from grad school is at <a href="http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~klitomis/index.html">here</a>.

		  I'm a hacker in the old-school sense of the word. I mess around with robots, drones, servers, back-ends and front-ends, and anything I see that I haven't messed around with yet. When I was little, I took a lot of things apart and put them back together to find a whole bunch of unnecessary components. I still do that, actually.

I'm drawn to new tech like Chuck Norris is to danger, which is why Admiral Ackbar's Code Emporium is powered by Jekyll Bootstrap.
