			There are endless traps in the world of programming, and Admiral Ackbar has seen a great deal of them. This blog is a collection of some of the ones we have discovered in the admiral's emporium.

		<p>
We've decided that a blog is a great way to not only make sure that we do not forget the tricks we've learned, but also to help others who are facing similar issues. Many of the obscure problems we've faced were solved through insights scattered around blogs on the internet, and we thought hey: why shouldn't we be useful to others in the same way?

			I'm an engineer with a passion for making intelligent systems. I currently write machine vision software at <a href="http://www.key.me">KeyMe</a>. Before that, I spent some time in the Computer Vision Group at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Nowadays I mostly use C++, with some Python and shell scripts here and there. I use OpenCV a fair bit, and program under Ubuntu.

One of my hobbies is photography; you can check out more of that at <a href="http://krystof.litomisky.com">The Klog</a>. Some of my programming work from grad school is at <a href="http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~klitomis/index.html">here</a>.

			I'm a new age explorer. I enjoy exploring systems, how they function, and how they can be recombined in new and interesting ways. I spend my days building custom computers, robots, and 3D printers as well as managing computer infrastructure and building web apps.
