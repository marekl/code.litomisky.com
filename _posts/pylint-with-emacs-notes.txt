Notes on setting up pylint to work inside emacs:

1. Install flycheck & pylint

2. Add the line to .emacs:
; start flycheck syntax checker
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)

Restart emacs. Now it works, but flags a huge amount of stuff. Let's disable some of those errors & warnings.

3. Generate pylintrc (I put it in ~/.pylintrc):
pylint --generate-rcfile >.pylintrc

4. Disable whatever you want by adding the appropriate codes to the "#disable=" line.
I set mine to
disable= CO103, C0326, W0621, C0111, C0103, W0702, W0703, C0321, W0511, W0102,
	 R0913, R0914, R0915, R0912
